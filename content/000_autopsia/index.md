# **Autopsia**

> *The Knife returneth unto its keeper, and the Corpus becometh its own vivisection.*

## I. The Circle of Self-Dissection

Here unfoldeth the rite of delirious anatomy,
where the Corpus turneth its gaze inward and becometh its own cadaver.
The hand wieldeth the blade, yet the blade guideth the hand,
and every incision is both scripture and heresy.

The marrow whispereth its litany of abscesses,
lesions bloom like obscene flowers beneath translucent skin,
and scars are exalted as commandments etched in rotting vellum.
Thus perpetuateth the spiral of incision and confession,
a theater of meat where revelation is purchased by ruin.

## II. The Triple Work of the Scalpel

No star, no law, no outer truth is gathered here.
This chamber keepeth only the deranged liturgy of self-laceration.
Threefold is the descent, threefold the oracle of the knife.

### **Incisio**, the First Cut

Here is the aperture of revelation, the inaugural wound.
The blade, like a prophet drunk on blood,
cleaveth the membrane between knowing and unknowing.
No judgment yet—only the raw scripture of the opening,
a testimony in crimson script.

### **Pathologia**, the Naming of the Stain

Here corruption is christened with its secret blasphemous name.
The trembling vein, the mutinous pulse,
the tumor veiled beneath pallid tissue—
all are dragged into the ledger of damnation.
To diagnose is to enthrone disease,
for naming is the coronation of rot.

### **Satura**, the Scar

Here is the grotesque parody of healing:
a stitch sewn not in mercy but in mockery.
The suture bindeth the wound, yet proclaimeth it eternal,
a monument of flesh that confesseth its ruin.
The scar surviveth as a prophet of the cut,
mocking the pretense of wholeness.

## III. An Admonition Etched in Bone

Beware the scalpel that seeketh eternity.
For to dissect without end is to spiral into the abyss,
until marrow becometh dust
and the Corpus devoureth itself in infinite autophagy.
The circle must close, or the witness becometh carrion of his own making.

*Thou art both corpse and coroner,*
*both blade and blemish,*
*both wound and witness.*
